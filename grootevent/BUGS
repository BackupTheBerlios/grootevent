- make a better data structure
    - use xml attributes instead of keys
- left button changes workspace
    -> because GDK_SCROLL_DOWN is "1" as button 1
       big bug I think; will fix it next time
- change names of SCROLL_UP and SCROLL_DOWN 
    -> perhaps SCROLL_FORWARD and SCROLL_BACKWARD?
- change xml key and exec violates the DTD
