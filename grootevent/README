grootevent - Desktop Manager
----------------------------

Infos for xml catalog files -> http://www.xmlsoft.org/catalog.html

set --sysconfdir=<path> to /etc or other xml-catalog!!

Be sure to use a recent metacity (or use the patch)
and deactivate Nautilus to manage the background!

A patch for older metacity version could be found on 
the berlios project site:

https://developer.berlios.de/projects/grootevent/

Be sure to have a WM that doesn't use the Root Windows, if you
start gRootEvent. Otherwise gRootEvent couldn't start. Nautilus
must be disabled for background. Execute this to disable Nautilus desktop:

gconftool-2 --type bool --set /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop false

to enable desktop:

gconftool-2 --type bool --set /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop true

If you like icons on your desktop, I recommend Rox Filter or idesk.
Both tools work with gRootEvent. But there are many more desktop
manager tools. Please tell me which tool you use and I'll list it 
here.

Happy wheel switching ;-)
